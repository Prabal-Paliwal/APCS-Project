#Electrical Circuit Simulator
##Information
Name - Prabal Paliwal
Teacher - Ms. Mouzakitis Pd6

##Description
This program is a terminal-based simulator for a linear circuit board.
I took inspriration from one of my childhood toy
###How it works
- You make a ElectricalLine class
- Then you add different components in it (LED, Speaker, etc..)
- Then you run the simulation where electricity passes through the line (from - to +)
- and you can run it again or check stats

##Compile
To compile the program, use:
javac *.java 

##Run
You can make different ElectricalLines in the Main class and run its main method
There is a sample simulation method already in there
